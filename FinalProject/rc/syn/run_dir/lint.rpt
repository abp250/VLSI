Sequential clock pins without clock waveform

The following sequential clock pins have no clock waveform driving them.  No    
timing constraints will be derived for paths leading to or from these pins.

Outputs without clocked external delays

The following primary outputs have no clocked external delays.  As a result the 
timing paths leading to the ports have no timing constraints derived from clock 
waveforms.  The'external_delay' command is used to create new external delays.

Inputs without external driver/transition

The following primary inputs have no external driver or input transition set.   
As a result the transition on the ports will be assumed as zero. The            
'external_driver' attribute is used to add and external driver or the           
'fixed_slew' attribute to add an external transition.

Outputs without external load

The following primary outputs have no external load set. As a result the load   
on the ports will be assumed as zero. The 'external_pin_cap' attribute is used  
to add and external pin cap.
